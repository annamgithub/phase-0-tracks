<!-- 
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
These tags offer further meaning within the html code, extending beyond simple presentation/appearance of the webpage. "<article>", for example, could indicate which part of the code is an article and <header> indicates which part is supposed to make up the header. This gives more standarized meaning for developers who are working in teams and can also be used to help create a more user-friendly experience for users with disabilities.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
html, head, body (and order elements are written within each) - flow from top to bottom and left to right.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned that you can save a lot lof time and work more efficiently by preparing snippets on Sublime. Will definitely create more in the future.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
I didn't find the challenge particularly difficult but I am still in the process of fully understanding the connection between HTML and how it is rendered by the browser. Reading pages like this has been helping: http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm

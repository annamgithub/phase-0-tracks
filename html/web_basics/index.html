	<h1>Hello world</h1>
	<p> For this exercise, I will be writing about cats. Yes, <strong>cats</strong> - apparently one of the most popular topics on the internet. I really don't mind, because cats are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>adorable</li>
			<li>independent, and</li>
			<li><em>hilarious.</em></li>
		</ul>
	

		<h2>How to Buy a Cat</h2>
		 Since I like cats so much (despite being severely allergic), I am going to teach you how to buy one.
		<ol>
			<li>Go to the pet shop.</li>
			<li>Identify the cat that you like the most.</li>
			<li>Purchase it.</li>
			<li>Take it home and take very good care of it.</li>
		</ol>

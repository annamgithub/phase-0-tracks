# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is when you are able to have control over multiple versions of a project. This comes with many benefits, including: storage of previous versions as backup, the ability to display a history of changes, and - if kept on a cloud-based service such a GitHub - allows you to share your work with other people.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branches are separate versions of your project. They "branch out" from the master version and you can work on each of these separate versions. You can later merge the changes you made on your branches with the master version. This allows many different aspects or features of the project to be worked on at once.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit makes a record of the changes to your repository. It is good to provide a brief yet detailed/precise commit message so that the change can be found and referred to when needed.


* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when the branch you are working on and the branch you want to merge it with have diverged in a way such that git cannot apply the changes in the newly merged version. This could occur, for example, when people are working on different versions of the same file and have made competing changes on the same lines. The files become conflicted when being merged because the changes in each file compete with one another.
